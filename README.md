2. The test page contains various types of links to test different behaviors:
   - Regular links (should be intercepted)
   - Special protocol links (should not be intercepted)
   - Links with modifier keys (should not be intercepted)
   - Dynamically added links (should be intercepted)

## Debugging

To debug the extension:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "ClickLoom - Safe Link Scanner" and click on "service worker"
3. This opens DevTools connected to the service worker
4. Look for `[ClickLoom Debug]` messages in the console
5. You can also check content script logs with `[ClickLoom Content]` and popup logs with `[ClickLoom Popup]`

## Technical Details

The extension uses:
- Manifest V3
- Chrome Storage API for URL handling
- Content Scripts for link interception
- Service Worker for background tasks
- DeclarativeNetRequest API for blocking navigation
- Axios for HTTP requests (included locally)
- Modern UI with responsive design

If the API is unavailable, the extension falls back to mock data for testing purposes.
